# RemindMe

This is a second iteration of an project I've been working on.
It was originally called 'trash_day', where a program would play an audio file to remind you to take out the trash.
You can check it out here: [trash_day](https://github.com/nampng/trash_day)

What does this iteration aim to accomplish? Well, I want a system where I can queue up ANY routine rather than one specific task.
I also want to be able to add, remove, and edit routines and their associated audio reminders as the program runs.
